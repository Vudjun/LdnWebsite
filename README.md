## Changelog

The complete list of changes is available [here](CHANGELOG.md)

## Contribute

### Development

We do encourage you talk to some devs in #development (on our Discord) before developing any PRs so we can make sure you aren't conflicting with another dev's plans, and so we can help you get accustomed to our code base and methods.

## Contact

If you have contributions, suggestions, need website support or just want to get in touch with the team, join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ryujinx).

## Donations

If you'd like to support the project financially, Ryujinx has an active Patreon campaign.

</a>

All developers working on the project do so in their free time, but the project has several expenses:

* Hackable Nintendo Switch consoles to reverse-engineer the hardware
* Additional computer hardware for testing purposes (e.g. GPUs to diagnose graphical bugs, etc.)
* Licenses for various software development tools (e.g. Jetbrains, IDA)
* Web hosting and infrastructure maintenance (e.g. LDN servers)

All funds received through Patreon are considered a donation to support the project. Patrons receive early access to progress reports and exclusive access to developer interviews.
